#  Solar System Orbit Animation

This project is a visual representation of our Solar System using only **HTML** and **CSS**. It features the Sun and all 8 planets, each orbiting at a unique distance with realistic speeds and colors. The background mimics outer space, and hovering over planets reveals their names and allows for a zoom-in 3D effect.

##  Features

- **Pure HTML & CSS** — No JavaScript frameworks or libraries used.
- **Animated Orbits** — Each planet orbits the Sun with distinct speeds.
- **Hover Effects** — 3D zoom-in and tooltip with planet names on hover.
- **Space-themed Background** — Enhances visual appeal.
- **Responsive Design** — Scales on most screen sizes.

##  Planets Included

- Mercury
- Venus
- Earth
- Mars
- Jupiter
- Saturn
- Uranus
- Neptune

Each planet is:
- Styled to reflect real-world appearance (color and size relative to others).
- Animated to orbit the Sun with proper distances.
- Enclosed within a dashed circular path indicating its orbit.

##  Future Enhancements
Here are some ideas to further enhance this project in the future:

🌕 Add Moons

Implement Earth's Moon and major moons for Jupiter, Saturn, and other planets.

Each moon can have its own smaller orbit path around the planet.

🔭 Planet Info on Click or Hover

Show detailed facts like size, distance from the Sun, temperature, and number of moons using tooltips or modals.

🌌 Zoom & Pan View

Allow users to zoom in/out and pan across the solar system for better exploration.

🌍 Day/Night Rotation

Simulate the rotation of planets on their own axes to show day and night cycles.

💫 Comets & Asteroid Belt

Animate Halley’s Comet and include the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.

🪐 Realistic Orbital Speeds

Make orbital speeds proportional to actual planetary revolution periods (e.g., Earth takes 365 days, Mercury takes 88 days).

🛰️ Add Spacecrafts or Satellites

Include famous spacecrafts like Voyager 1, Juno, or the ISS orbiting Earth.

📱 Mobile Optimization

Improve responsiveness and performance on mobile and tablet devices.

🎵 Add Background Music or Sound FX

Ambient space music or hover/click sounds for an immersive experience.

🔗 Planet Navigation Bar

Add a clickable planet menu that automatically zooms or scrolls to the selected planet.
